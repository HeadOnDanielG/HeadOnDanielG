# Servus Hi

## 🛠 Things I Can Fix (sometimes):

- 🐛 Bugs (if they’re small, cute ones)
- 🔧 Pipelines (on a good day)
- ☕ Coffee machines (but only if they run Kubernetes)

## 👨‍💻 My Development Cycle:

1. Write code
2. *It compiles on the first try?*
3. Break everything
4. Fix nothing
5. Blame Kubernetes
6. Take a coffee break ☕
7. Repeat

## 🏆 Achievements:

- **Stack Overflow Enthusiast**: I give back to the community (mostly by asking questions and hoping for the best).
- **Kubernetes Explorer**: I once entered a YAML rabbit hole and haven’t been the same since.
- **90% Typo-Free**: The other 10%? Let’s call it “creativity.”

## 🎉 Fun Extras:

- ⚡️ **Power Move**: Commenting out code until it works.  
- 🐦 **Spirit Animal**: Rubber duck debugger. 🦆
- 🚀 **Mission**: To boldly code where no one has debugged before.

## 💬 Reach Out

If you need me, I’m probably in a meeting trying to explain why "it worked on my machine!" 🙃
